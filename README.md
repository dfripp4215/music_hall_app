# Music Hall Website

This Webapp was completed while I was studying General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. Music Hall lets users login/signup, search songs and artists, create their own playlists, edit the playlists, and delete them. For security all user passwords are encrypted before they get sent to the database and no PSQL inputs the user can make are able to alter the database other than whats intended.

I want to give a quick shoutout to my instructors Zara, Alex and Kasun for helping me with this course, and also the class of SEIxr04 for making the 8 hour classes fly by.

## Planning

I started by brainstorming ideas for the website, once I has the idea to make it around playlist creation I made a wireframe of the flow of my website. Then I created the basic layout of how I wanted it to look before searching if there are any free API's that could help. 

Before I started to code I made psudocode of everything I'd need to do within my website, along with connecting to my API and database.

## Future Features

* Display message when a user has no playlists made.
* Display message when a playlist is empty.
* Users to be able to upload and see other users playlists. Comment on them, like them and save them.
* Add more styling and animations to the top 10 list; make it a slideshow.
